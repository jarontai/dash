# Dash - A tiny interpreter written in Dart.

Dash is a interpreter fully build with [Dart](https://dart.dev). Dash is also a toy language which is a subset of the [Dart](https://dart.dev) language.

## Language

The little Dash language includes a small subset of the [Dart](https://dart.dev) language features:

  * C-like syntax and keywords
  * arithmetic expressions
  * intergers, doubles and booleans
  * string, array and map
  * functions and closures

  ```
    // Dash code

    var one = 1;
    var tpf = 2.5;

    var add = (x, y) {
      return x + y;
    };

    var result = add(one, tpf);
  ```

## Interpreter

The Dash interpreter is build to parse the Dash language, which includes following:

  * the lexer
  * the parser
  * the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
  * the evaluator

## Run REPL
// TODO:

    $ pub run bin/repl
    

## Test

    $ pub run test
